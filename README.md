Description: Colour To HTML is a small Windows utility to convert colours into HTML, RGB and CMYK code. This is a mirror of https://www.colourtohtml.matthewhipkin.co.uk/.

It runs on Windows 7, 8, 10 and most likely 11 as well. It was made with Lazarus. The author did not provide build instructions nor source code this time - I'll ask him for the latter.
